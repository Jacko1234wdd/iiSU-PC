"""
iiSU launch bridge.

Listens on the AVD's host-loopback address (10.0.2.2 from inside the emulator
== this machine, on the configured port) for the raw Intent dump sent by the
patched com.iisulauncher.pcbridge.LaunchBridge class. Each connection carries
exactly one launch request; the socket is closed after the payload is sent.

For each request, this:
  1. Parses the component package name and ROM URI out of the Intent dump
     (ROMs travel via ClipData, sent separately as CLIPURI: lines, since
     Intent.toString() only shows a truncated placeholder for ClipData).
  2. Matches the package name against config.json's "emulators" map to find
     a PC emulator (name + fullscreen flag) and searches "search_roots" for
     its executable.
  3. Takes the ROM filename from the end of the URI and looks it up under
     "roms_dir" by matching filename (the patched app can only tell us what
     it knows about its own Android-side content URI, not a Windows path,
     so both sides need to agree on ROM filenames living in roms_dir).
  4. Minimizes the iiSU/AVD window, launches the matching emulator in
     fullscreen, forces it to the foreground, and synthesizes a click so
     keyboard/controller input is picked up immediately (Qt apps track
     actual input focus on their render widget, separately from the OS-level
     foreground window).
  5. Waits for the emulator to exit (either normally, or forced via the
     configured quit_hotkey) and restores the iiSU window (maximized if
     "iisu_fullscreen" is set), mirroring how the real Android launcher
     reappears once a game exits.

All configuration (ROM directory, emulator search paths, package->emulator
mappings, quit hotkey, display settings) lives in config.json next to this
script. Window-management helpers live in winapi.py, shared with
apply_display.py and manager.py. One Python stdlib script, no dependencies.

    package here, its profile can't just be "one PC exe". Its entry is
    instead a "by_extension" map, normally resolved by the ROM's own file
    extension to the real dedicated PC emulator for that system.

    A ROM extension that already resolves to a dedicated standalone exe
    (PSX/Dreamcast, via RETROARCH_SAFETY_NET_EXTENSIONS -- recognizable

    LIBRETRO=flycast_libretro_android.so even with Flycast picked in iiSU.
    Running the real standalone emulator instead also sidesteps ever
    needing that RetroArch core installed at all for these two consoles.

    Failing that, android_core (the intent's LIBRETRO extra, when present)
    takes priority over the extension guess whenever it resolves to a known
    Windows core -- it's the *actual* core iiSU/RetroArch decided to launch

    default (e.g. a .zip-packaged ROM has no extension the curated map
    would recognize at all, or the console's default core has since been
    changed on the Android side). The exe_names/pre_args *shape* still
