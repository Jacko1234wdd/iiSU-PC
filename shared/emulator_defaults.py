"""
Default console -> PC emulator mappings, curated from iiSU's own bundled
emuladores_default.json (its list of consoles and, per console, which
Android packages it recognizes as compatible emulators).

Two shapes, matching bridge/config.json's "emulators" map:

STANDALONE_DEFAULTS: one Android package -> one PC executable. The
Android package chosen is iiSU's own top-priority candidate for that
console (the first "emulators" entry with a "packages" list) -- it's
stubbed (see installer/stub_apk.py) purely so iiSU's installed-package
check resolves that console to a package our patched LaunchBridge already
recognizes. What that Android package's real app would actually do is
irrelevant: our patch intercepts the launch before Android would ever
start it, and redirects to whatever PC executable is configured here
instead, regardless of whether the two projects are related at all (e.g.
PS2 is stubbed under AetherSX2's package but redirected to PCSX2 on PC --
there's no Android PCSX2 to begin with).

RETROARCH_BY_EXTENSION: consoles routed through a single shared
com.retroarch stub, disambiguated by the ROM's file extension the same
way bridge/launch_bridge.py already does for PS1/Dreamcast. Only
extensions that don't collide with another entry in this same map are
included here -- e.g. Saturn and MAME/arcade are deliberately left out,
since their extensions (.bin/.cue/.iso/.chd/.zip/.7z) overlap too broadly
with everything else on this list to disambiguate correctly from the
extension alone. Getting that right needs resolving the ROM's own console
folder, not just its extension, which is a bigger change than this list
is trying to be.

RetroArch itself is launched as retroarch.exe -L <core> <rom>, so pre_args
includes -L and a core path relative to wherever retroarch.exe is found
(standard "cores/xxx_libretro.dll" layout) -- this assumes the matching
core is already installed there, same as RetroArch itself needs to be
already installed for this to do anything.
